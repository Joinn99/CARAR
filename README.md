## File

The proposed Correlation-aware Review Aspect Recommender System (CARAR) includes three detailed steps. All corresponding codes are stored in `Model/`:

1. `Model/CARAR_C.m` : Self-representation correlation mapping.
2. `Model/CARAR_LF.m` : Latent factors updating.
3. `Model/CARAR_W.m` : Incorporaing additional information.

Each function above is called by `Model/CARAR.m` to formulate the full CARAR model.

## Datasets

- Yelp [^1]
- Beeradvocate [^2]
- HotelRec [^3]
- OpenRice [^4] Text / Emoji

All datasets are stored in `Data/` in `.mat` Matlab workspace files. Each file include:
- `D` (N * d): Additional information for each record.
- `E` (N * l): Review aspect labels for each record.
- `is` (N * 1): Item ID for each record.
- `iu` (N * 1): User ID for each record.
- `Label_E`  (Only available for OpenRice Text / OpenRice Emoji): Descriptions for each review aspect.

You can download the datasets we used at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--OJ0a_2bEQ9yy64NX2JmYf1vFDyV72Z/view?usp=sharing). Extract the downloaded zip file and put them in `Data/`.

## Usage

### Environment

- [MathWorks MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) R2019b or laber
  - [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/parallel-computing/index.html) required
- This code is designed to run in a GPU environment and is not adapted for environments without a GPU.

### Running demos

Specify the dataset in `demo.m` and run the script. The best hyperparameters will be loaded automatically to run the demo. 

If you like to choose different hyperparameters, change them manually in `Model/CARAR.m`.
